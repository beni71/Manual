### postStoreProcess function in TagsHelper.php

PR: https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/pull/40613
File: libraries/src/Helper/TagsHelper.php
Description: With the new possibility to batch remove a tag, the `postStoreProcess()` function of class `\Joomla\CMS\Helper\TagsHelper` has been deprecated and will be removed in 7.0.
Replacement: `postStore()` function which has an additional optional parameter `$remove` (default value is `false`) indicating whether the tags in parameter `$newTags` should be removed. If you set it to `true` then the parameter `$replace` is ignored.
